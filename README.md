# Habit Tracker API

The goal of Habit Tracker is to encourage people to build sustainable, weekly habits. This is done by entering a set of habits with how many times you want to do each one per week (e.g. go on a jog twice a week). 

Features to be worked on:
* Historical tracking of habit completion
* Automatically prompt user to roll habits to next week
* Encouragement reminders to push users to complete goals
